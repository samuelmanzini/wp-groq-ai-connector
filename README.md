## What this plugin does

- Registers **Groq** as a provider in the WordPress 7.0 **Connectors Gallery** (Settings → Connectors), alongside Anthropic, Google and OpenAI.
- Integrates Groq with the **PHP AI Client** bundled in the `ai` plugin, enabling WordPress AI features (title generation, excerpt generation, alt text, content classification, and more) to use Groq models.
- Adds a **Settings → Groq AI** page where you choose the default model from all available Groq models.
- Your API key is stored securely in the native Connectors system — not duplicated in a separate settings field.

Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit) delivers inference speeds significantly faster than traditional GPU-based providers, making it ideal for AI-powered editorial workflows where latency matters.

## FAQ

**Do I need a paid Groq account?**
No. Groq offers a free tier with generous rate limits. See [groq.com/pricing](https://groq.com/pricing).

**Where do I enter my API key?**
In **Settings → Connectors**, not in the Groq AI settings page. All API keys are managed centrally there.

**Will this work with third-party plugins that use the WordPress AI Client?**
Yes. Any plugin that calls `wp_ai_client_prompt()` or uses the AI Service will automatically use Groq.

**Can I use multiple AI providers at the same time?**
Yes. WordPress 7.0 supports multiple configured providers. Groq will be used first for text generation and fall back to the next provider for unsupported capabilities (e.g. image generation).
